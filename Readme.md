# Job Gauge Adjustments
A Dalamud plugin to adjust basic parts of the default simple gauge layouts

## Installation
Until the plugin can get through Pull Requests on the official Dalamud repo, you need to point directly here.
Add a custom repo to your Dalamud Settings > Experimental > Custom Plugin repositories:
https://raw.githubusercontent.com/SupineSnail/SupineSnail.JobGaugeAdjustments/main/repo.json

This will be removed once/if through Dalamud approval
